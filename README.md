# Chronology
This repository contains an R code script with 18 sections. It enables the user to produce a seriation-based intra-site chronology using correspondence analysis and ware type manufacturing dates.  


An important consideration is choosing the UNIT variable. This variable determines the level at which assemblages are aggregated in the analysis. You will need to cutomize this logic for YOUR site. There are circumstances where it will make the most sense to group by SGs (stratigraphic groups) or Features, but in others you may need to use contexts. Note, you should only use ONE option, either 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, or 6.4.  The rest should be commented out.


## Requirements
